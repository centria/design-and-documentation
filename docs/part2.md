# ER Diagrams

An entity-relationship model describes interralated items of interest in a specific domain. A basic ER model is composed of entity types and specifies relationships between those entities. In software engineering, the ER model can be used to describe for example business models, but also data models or software structures.

ER models are not part of the UML standard, but are still quite often used. They are used for example conceptualizing a software, before actually implementing said software. Let us use one of our previous class diagrams as an example, and change that into an ER diagram.

Starting off small, let us have the class "Person" as an ER diagram.
