# Recap of the course

So far we have looked on the basics of diagrams, how to create them based on code, and how to create different kinds of diagrams, based on their use. We have also looked into design and architectural aspects in more abstract level.

As an exercise for the previous part, you could influence the topics of this part. Most of the answers were about recapping the topics we have handled so far, but also another topic arose: having more concrete examples.

The last two lessons we had on quite an abstract level, and handled quite a lot of repetitive information, including links to outside sources (mainly Wikipedia). Let's look into this a little bit deeper with another example project, namely the Software Tools Final Project, with which everyone should be somewhat familiar.

## "The process"

One term used throughout the course, sometimes a bit vaguely I admit, is "the process". The process is the task of doing something from the beginning, step by step, and achieving the desired end result. Let's take a look a little bit of "the process", using the Softare Tools Final Project as an example.

The process parts we want to look into:
* Design process
  * Analyze the problem
  * Design the system interface
  * Design the architecture
  * Design the details

As a part of the previous process, there is of course the
* Architectural process
  * Analysis
  * Synthesis
  * Evaluation
  * Evolution

With all these, we also have the
* Design patterns
* Architectural patterns

## The tools

For us to be successful in our documentation, we have to know how to create our documents properly. Let's wrap everything we have done above in a nice MD-file with some charts and example code.

## Other stuff

So far we have done only one style of software, and that is monolithic, single-system software. There are of course other types of software out there, and they use different kinds of architectural and design patterns and styles. If we have the time, I can show a couple that I have created, just to ease up your curiosity.
