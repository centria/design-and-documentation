# Exercises

## Part 1

* Return these exercises as an email, by 28.4.2020 at 23:59:59. Create **one** PDF (or docs or something, preferably pdf), where you have all the answers. **ONLY ONE FILE IS ACCEPTED AS RETURN!**

* In the end, you should have **one document**, with **five diagrams**/pictures.

* You can use any of the tools mentioned in the material.

### Exercise 1

* Draw a class diagram that represents the following code, and save it in your return document:

```cs
public class Person
{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName) {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name =  initialName;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 2

* Draw a class diagram that represents the following code, and save it in your return document, *as another picture*:

```cs
public class Person
{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }

  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }

  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 3

* Draw a class diagram that represents the following code, and save it in your return document, *as another picture*:

```cs
public class ClockHand
{
  public int value { get; set; }
  public int limit { get; set; }

  public ClockHand(int limit)
  {
    this.limit = limit;
    this.value = 0;
  }

  public void Advance()
  {
    this.value = this.value + 1;

    if (this.value >= this.limit)
    {
      this.value = 0;
    }
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    if (this.value < 10)
    {
      return "0" + this.value;
    }

    return "" + this.value;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 4

* Draw a class diagram that represents the following code, and save it in your return document, *as another picture*.

**NOTICE!** This class has relation to ClockHand. In your diagram, also include the diagram for ClockHand, and their relation!

```cs
public class Clock
{
  private ClockHand hours;
  private ClockHand minutes;
  private ClockHand seconds;

  public Clock()
  {
    this.hours = new ClockHand(24);
    this.minutes = new ClockHand(60);
    this.seconds = new ClockHand(60);
  }

  public void Advance()
  {
    this.seconds.Advance();

    if (this.seconds.value == 0)
    {
      this.minutes.Advance();

      if (this.minutes.value == 0)
      {
        this.hours.Advance();
      }
    }
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 5

* Draw a class diagram that represents the following code, with relations, and save it in your return document, *as another picture*.

```cs
public interface IStorable
{
  double Weight();
}
```

```cs
public class CD : IStorable
{
  public string artist;
  public string name;
  public double weight;
  public int year;
  public CD(string artist, string name, int year)
  {
    this.artist = artist;
    this.name = name;
    this.weight = 0.1;
    this.year = year;
  }

  public double Weight()
  {
    return this.weight;
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return this.artist + " - " + this.name + " (" + this.year + ")";
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Book : IStorable
{
  public string author;
  public string name;
  public double weight;
  public Book(string author, string name, double weight)
  {
    this.author = author;
    this.name = name;
    this.weight = weight;
  }

  public double Weight()
  {
    return this.weight;
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return this.author + ": " + this.name;
  }
}
```

```cs
public class ChocolateBar : IStorable
{
  // Because C#'s automatically generated default constructor is enough,
  // we don't need a constructor

  public double Weight()
  {
    return 0.2;
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return "Candybar, weight: " + Weight();
  }
}
```


```cs
public class Factory
{
  public IStorable ProduceNew()
  {
    Random ticket = new Random();
    // increase the range by one
    int number = ticket.Next(0, 5);

    if (number == 0)
    {
      return new CD("Pink Floyd", "Dark Side of the Moon", 1973);
    }
    else if (number == 1)
    {
      return new CD("Wigwam", "Nuclear Nightclub", 1975);
    }
    else if (number == 2)
    {
      return new Book("Robert Martin", "Clean Code", 1);
    }
    else if (number == 3)
    {
      return new Book("Kent Beck", "Test Driven Development", 0.7);
    }
    else
    {
      return new ChocolateBar();
    }
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Packer
{
  private Factory factory;

  public Packer()
  {
    this.factory = new Factory();
  }

  public List<IStorable> GiveAListOfThings()
  {
    List<IStorable> list = new List<IStorable>();

    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10)
    {
      IStorable newThing = factory.ProduceNew();
      list.add(newThing);

      i = i + 1;
    }

    return list;
  }
}
```

## Part 2

* Return these exercises as an email, by 5.5.2020 at 23:59:59. Create **one** PDF (or docs or something, preferably pdf), where you have all the answers. **ONLY ONE FILE IS ACCEPTED AS RETURN!**

* In the end, you should have **one document** with **four diagrams**.

* You can create ER diagrams with for example [**https://erdplus.com/standalone**](https://erdplus.com/standalone).

* You can create Sequence diagrams with for example [**https://sequencediagram.org/**](https://sequencediagram.org/).

* You can create Sequence diagrams with for example [**https://draw.io**](https://draw.io)

* If you feel more comfortable with other tools, you are welcome to use those as well, these are only examples.

### Exercise 1

* Draw an ER diagram for the following class:

```cs
public class Person
{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }

  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }

  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```


### Exercise 2

* Create an ER diagram for the following classes: 

```cs
public class ClockHand
{
  public int value { get; set; }
  public int limit { get; set; }

  public ClockHand(int limit)
  {
    this.limit = limit;
    this.value = 0;
  }

  public void Advance()
  {
    this.value = this.value + 1;

    if (this.value >= this.limit)
    {
      this.value = 0;
    }
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    if (this.value < 10)
    {
      return "0" + this.value;
    }

    return "" + this.value;
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Clock
{
  private ClockHand hours;
  private ClockHand minutes;
  private ClockHand seconds;

  public Clock()
  {
    this.hours = new ClockHand(24);
    this.minutes = new ClockHand(60);
    this.seconds = new ClockHand(60);
  }

  public void Advance()
  {
    this.seconds.Advance();

    if (this.seconds.value == 0)
    {
      this.minutes.Advance();

      if (this.minutes.value == 0)
      {
        this.hours.Advance();
      }
    }
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
  }
}
```

Remember to put in the relation!

### Exercise 3

* Consider the **Clock** and **ClockHand** above. Using this Main:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  Clock clock = new Clock();

  while (true)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(clock);
    clock.Advance();
  }
}
```

* Create a sequence diagram.

NOTICE! This will create an endless loop, so your loop does not have a break point.

### Exercise 4

* Consider the following code:

```cs
using System;

public class Account 
{
  public double balance { get; set; }
  private string owner;

  public Account(string owner, double balance) 
  {
      this.balance = balance;
      this.owner = owner;
  }

  public void Deposit(double amount) 
  {
      this.balance = this.balance + amount;
  }

  public void Withdrawal(double amount) 
  {
      this.balance = this.balance - amount;
  }

  public override string ToString()
  {
    return this.owner + " balance: " + this.balance;
  }
}
```

* Code in the Main:

```cs
using System;

class Program
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Account heikkisAccount = new Account("Heikki's account", 100.00);
    Account heikkisSwissAccount = new Account("Heikki's account in Switzerland", 1000000.00);

    Console.WriteLine("Intial state");
    Console.WriteLine(heikkisAccount);
    Console.WriteLine(heikkisSwissAccount);

    heikkisAccount.Withdrawal(20);
    Console.WriteLine("The balance of Heikki's account is now: " + heikkisAccount.balance);
    heikkisSwissAccount.Deposit(200);
    Console.WriteLine("The balance of Heikki's other account is now: " + heikkisSwissAccount.balance);

    Console.WriteLine("End state");
    Console.WriteLine(heikkisAccount);
    Console.WriteLine(heikkisSwissAccount);
  }
}
```

* Draw a sequence diagram of what happens in the main.

## Part 3

* Return these exercises as an email, by 12.5.2020 at 23:59:59. Create **one** .MD file. **ONLY ONE FILE IS ACCEPTED AS RETURN!** Do not change the format of the file, let it be MD!

* In the end, you should have **one MD file**.

### Exercise 1

* Create an .MD file (for example, answers.md). Save all your answers for this part in this file.
* Start with the header *## Exercise 1* in your file
* Complete the exercises in [**https://www.markdowntutorial.com/**](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
* Copy all the answer-texts into the file for returning the exercise.
  * You might want to give these some smaller headers for clarity 

### Exercise 2

* In the same file, add a header *## Exercise 2*
* Search the internet for **at least 2** more markup languages not mentioned in the material or in the example below. They can be from for example the Wikipedia page mentioned in the material.
* **Using Markdown**, write a short introduction of those languages.
   * For example, *"**TeX** is a typesetting system (or a "**formatting system**") which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, linguistics, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology. It has largely displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatting system, in many Unix installations which use both for different purposes. It is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially in the form of **LaTeX**, ConTeXt, and other macro packages."*.
* Add some highlights to the text to make it more vivid, like above.

### Exercise 3

* In the same file, add a header *## Exercise 3*
* Add an embedded video from YouTube to your file
  * You can rickroll me if you want
* Add your favourite cat/dog/pet/animal picture in the file
  * Notice! Do not add the picture to your submission, but use the image tags to get the image visible.

### Exercise 4

* In the same file, add a header *## Exercise 4*
* Add the following code snippet as a code snippet to your file:

```cs
public class Person
{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }

  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }

  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```

## Part 4

No exercises as the next lecture is postponed due to public holiday.

Thematically, parts 4 and 5 are quite close together, so exercises are combined anyways. See below.

## Part 5

* Return these exercises as an email, by 2.6.2020 at 23:59:59. Create **one** PDF (or docs or something, preferably pdf), where you have all the answers. **ONLY ONE FILE IS ACCEPTED AS RETURN!**

* In the end, you should have **one document** of about one to two pages!

### Exercise 1

Examine your [**Software Tools Final Project**](https://centria.github.io/software-tools/part7/) that your group created. 

* What kind of *design patterns* do you find? Why? 

Find "all" the design patterns you find in your work, and explain, what shows that pattern from your work. For example:

*"In our project, we have single responsibilty principle, as each class or function has responsibility over a single part of the functionality. For example, the tame animal naming function only names the animal, and does nothing else."*

It is, of course, impossible to find all of the existing patterns, as there are way too many for them in existance, but you should be able to find 5 to 10 quite easily.

### Exercise 2

Examine your [**Software Tools Final Project**](https://centria.github.io/software-tools/part7/) that your group created. 

* What kind of *architecture styles or patterns* do you find? Why?

Pick the ones that suit your software the best. Write about (half) a page, describing which features of your software implement that style and/or pattern.

### Exercise 3

* If you were to do the Software Tools Final Project again: 
  * Knowing the basics of design process and concepts, how could you use these while creating the project?
  * Being now aware of the different kinds of design patterns and architecture styles, would you do something differently? 
    * Why/why not?

Few sentences of each is quite enough, but you can write longer if you wish.

### Exercise 4

We have now gone through the *very basics* of documentation and design, but have one more lesson to go.

* Is there something you would like us to handle on the last lesson?
* Do you feel like something's missing?
* Would you like to recap a certain topic more thoroughly?

NOTICE! This particular exercise is voluntary, but I do appreciate if you answer, so we'll have topics for the last lesson!

DISCLAIMER: There's no promise of handling every request, but let's try and satisfy as many as possible.
